# ThynkEra - Development Guide

## Quick Start (No Setup Required)

The app is designed to work out-of-the-box for development:

```bash
npm start
# Your app is ready at http://localhost:3000
```

## Console Messages

You may see a helpful setup message in the console. This is **not an error** - it's just informational.

### To Suppress Setup Messages

Add this to your `.env` file:
```env
REACT_APP_SUPPRESS_SETUP_WARNINGS=true
```

### To Enable Full Admin Features

Add Supabase credentials to your `.env` file:
```env
REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-project-url
REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
```
